If \nthis is unavoidable, use curtains to shade the \nscanner.\n●Avoid locations where a considerable amount of \ndust accumulates.\n●Avoid warm or humid locations, such as in the \nvicinity of a water faucet, water heater, or \nhumidifier, and avoid locations where the fumes \nfrom ammonia, paint thinner, or other volatile \nchemicals may be present.\n●Avoid locations that are subject to vibration.\n●Avoid exposing the scanner to rapid changes in \ntemperature. If the room in which the scanner is \ninstalled is cold but rapidly heated, water droplets \n(condensation) may form inside the scanner. This \nmay result in a noticeable degradation in scanning \nquality.\nThe following conditions are recommended for \noptimal scanning quality:\nRoom temperature: 10 °C to 32.5 °C (50 °F to \n90.5 °F)\nHumidity: 20% to 80% RH\n●Avoid installing the scanner near equipment that \ngenerates a magnetic field (e.g. speakers, \ntelevisions, or radios).\nAt least \n15.75\" \n(40 cm)\nAt least \n25.59\" (65 cm)"

Also, when using an extension cord, \nmake sure that the extension cord is rated for the \ncurrent requirements of the scanner.\n●Never try to disassemble the AC adapter or modify \nit in any way, as this is extremely dangerous.\n●The power cord and AC adapter may become \ndamaged if they are often stepped on or if heavy \nobjects are placed on them. Continued use of a \ndamaged power cord and AC adapter can lead to \nan accident, such as a fire or electrical shock.\n●Do not use the power cord while it is coiled.\n●Do not pull directly on the power cord. When \ndisconnecting the power cord, grasp the plug and \nremove it from the outlet.\n●Keep the area around the power plug clear of \nobjects so that the power cord can be \ndisconnected easily in an emergency.\n●Use only the AC adapter provided with this \nscanner. Also, do not use the AC adapter provided \nwith the scanner with any other electrical devices.\nModel: MG1-5039\n●If you have any questions regarding the power \nsupply, contact your local authorized Canon dealer \nor service representative for further information.\n❏Moving the Scanner\n●When moving the scanner, always hold it with both \nhands to avoid dropping it. The weight of the \nscanner unit is approximately 9.92 lbs (4.5 kg). \n●Before moving the scanner, make sure the \ndocument tray is closed and the interface cable \nand AC adapter are disconnected. If the scanner is \ntransported with these items connected, the plugs \nand connectors may be damaged due to \nexcessive force applied to them during movement.\n❏Handling\nWARNING\nNote the following precautions whenever using the \nscanner. Failure to do so may result in a fire or \nelectric shock.\n■Never use alcohol, benzene, paint thinner, aerosol \nsprays, or any other highly flammable substance \nnear the scanner.\n■Do not cut, damage, or modify the power cord or \nAC adapter. Do not place heavy objects on the \npower cord or AC adapter, and do not pull or \nexcessively bend the power cord."

Scanning documents with pencil \nwritten on them may soil the rollers or scanning glass, cause \nstripes to appear in images, or dirty other documents.\n• When scanning a two-sided document that is printed on thin \npaper, the image on the opposite side of each page may show \nthrough. Adjust the brightness in the scanning conditions \nbefore scanning the document.\n• When scanning thin paper documents, feed errors may occur \ndepending on the paper type, and the documents may be \nscanned and ejected out of order.\n• Laminated documents may not be scanned correctly, \ndepending on the document.\n• Note that scanning the following types of documents can \ncause a paper jam or malfunction.

The patch code sheets are stored on the supplied \ninstructions and utilities CD-ROM as PDF files.\nIMPORTANT\n• Print [PATCH T (A4)] and [PATCH II (A4)] on A4 size paper \nand [PATCH T (LTR)] and [PATCH II (LTR)] on letter size \npaper, always in their original size.\n• If a patch code sheet is enlarged or reduced for printing, the \npatch code may not be recognized.\nPatch code pattern functions\nPatch codes are separated into two patterns, PATCH T and \nPATCH II, each with different functions.\n• PATCH T\nWhen a sheet with this pattern is recognized, the file is \nseparated with the image of the next sheet heading the \nnext file.\nYou can specify whether to save the patch code sheet \nimage with the [Record the paper separated file] setting \n(see p. 100).\n• PATCH II\nWhen a sheet with this pattern is recognized, the file is \nseparated with the image of this sheet heading the next \nfile.
