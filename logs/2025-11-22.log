2025-11-22 13:57:30 | INFO | LLM | LLM REPLY  The lack of internet access on your VirtualBox VM's bridged adapter might be due to one of the following reasons:

1. The maximum allowed lter count was reached on the host, which prevented the network driver from being loaded.

2. There is an issue with the network configuration or the drivers installed in the guest OS that are not compatible with the host's Crossbow functionality (on Oracle Solaris 11 hosts).

3. The bridged adapter is not enabled in the VirtualBox settings for the VM.

4. The Guest Additions are not properly configured, which might be affecting the networking capabilities of the guest OS.

5. There is a conflict between the network drivers installed in the host and the guest OS.

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try disabling any recently installed network drivers or software on your host, and then see if the bridged adapter in VirtualBox allows internet access to the VM.
